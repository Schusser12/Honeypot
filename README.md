This JavaScript program automates IP delisting requests on Project Honey Pot using Puppeteer. It dynamically retrieves the public IP, fills out the form fields, handles CAPTCHA input by prompting the user, and retries up to 3 times if needed. It runs in headless mode, ensuring efficient automation while providing clear logs for success or failure.
