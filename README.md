# delister
This JavaScript program automates IP delisting requests on Project Honey Pot using Puppeteer. It dynamically retrieves the public IP, fills out the form fields, handles CAPTCHA input by prompting the user, and retries up to 3 times if needed. It runs in headless mode, ensuring efficient automation while providing clear logs for success or failure.

Designed for CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core)

## Original addition
Implemented the ProjectHoneyPot.sh script.
This script checks IP addresses against Project Honey Pot to see if they've been whitelisted or blacklisted.

When you run the script, it will read a list of IPs from a file. The file should contain one IP address per line.
Each IP is checked on Project Honey Potâ€™s website, and the script will look for any whitelist-related messages.

The latest relevant notice is shown for each IP, along with its status (e.g. Currently Whitelisted, Blacklisted, Scheduled for Whitelist, or Unknown).
